This file is for testing out `gtrendsR` and finding more trends to use. First, the libraries are loaded.

```{r}
#| message: false
library(tidyverse)
library(gtrendsR)
```

Now, the `gtrendsR` package includes a `categories` dataset that gives the name of a trend category and its id.

```{r}
head(categories)
```

Now two things I enjoy on a near-daily basis are coffee and podcasts. I decided to search these in Google Trends. The results were stored in `trend_data.csv`. This was done in a different R script to avoid having it run whenever the document is rendered.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| file: "download_trends.R"
```

This data is now previewed.

```{r}
#| message: false
read_csv("data/trend_data.csv") %>%
  head()
```
