# Problem_02_replaced_data

This is a modified copy of Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's Google Trend Index Shiny application. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/rstudio/webinars/tree/master/47-introduction-to-shiny/apps/goog-index).

The data from the original was changed to topics of my interests. The only modification to the original `app.R` file was that the date range was expanded to include all trend data up to November 2022.

The process for replacing the data can be found in `trends.md`.

The modified application can be found at the link below:
